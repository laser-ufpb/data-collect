A lot of images are not build now. 
To build new images, use the programm : < SAC_DM_compare_graph_for_csv.py > from the << data-collect >> folder
and save it here. 

Every data can be used for the sac-dm (I prefer cut_version datas or new ones with timestemp). 
It have to be compare with files from the << simulated_failure_data >> folder 
to run the SAC_DM_compare_graph_for_csv.py script
